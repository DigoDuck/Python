# Virtual Environments in Python
# A virtual environment loads your entire Python installation into a folder at your chosen path.
# When you activate a virtual environment, the virtual environment's installation will be used.
# venv is the module we will use to create virtual environments.
# We can name a virtual environment whatever we prefer, but the most common names are: venv, env, .venv, and .env
